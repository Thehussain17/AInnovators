The project is our approach towards maximizing teaching efficiency by reducing focus on marks based learning and rather fostering an outcome based learning environment. This is 
our submission for GOOGLE SOLUTION CHALLENGE, and with this we also aim to reduce teaching workload and increase efficiency..
In order to run this project, first clone it in your systems locally, pip install the requirements.txt file and then run the main.py.

That would lead you to our MVP. We believe this project can revolutionize the education system, if implemented correctly.
Thank you for reading.
